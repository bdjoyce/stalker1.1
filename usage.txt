Usage will be pretty much the same as the original stalker:

Adjust the horizontal cross bar to the desired height
*For normal in-field operation the hardware should be calibrated at the beginning of use and at every height change
**Calibrate by taking a measurement against open air (no plants)
**Place foot on hinge end and hold instrument straight up and down
*Power up the unit by flipping the power switch
**LED will be solid red during initialization (1 second)
**Then flashing red/blue during settling (5 seconds)
**Then solid blue when measurement is ready
***If LED stays solid red - something did not initialize check SD card log file for details
*Push the vertical bar forward until the LED turns solid red indicating a 45 degree angle has been reached
**Results will be more accurate if pushed using a steady, smooth motion
*Bring vertical bar back to straight up and down
*Power off the unit

After each measurement a log file is created with the following contents.  The filename is controlled by OpenLog configuration and will be LOG#####.TXT by default with the number incrementing every time the device is powered on regardless of whether or not a measurement was completed.

*initialization log
*throwaway measurement line
